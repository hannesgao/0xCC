# 0xCC: Cross-Chain P2P Payments with Privacy

---

## 🚀 The Problem

### Current Payment Solutions Fail Users

- **Venmo/PayPal**: Your financial life is public
- **Crypto Wallets**: Too complex for everyday use  
- **Cross-chain**: Nearly impossible for regular users
- **Group Payments**: Manual tracking, awkward conversations

*"Split the bill" shouldn't necesseryly mean "share your bank balance or amount to pay"*

---

## 💡 Our Solution: 0xCC

### Privacy-First Cross-Chain Payments for Everyone

- **Send money across any Polkadot parachain** - One app, all chains
- **Split bills with ZK privacy** - Friends see their share, not your balance
- **Social payments made simple** - QR codes, usernames, no addresses
- **Built on Polkadot** - Secure, scalable, interoperable

---

## 🎯 Demo: Real-World Use Case

### Restaurant Bill Splitting

1. **Create Group** → Generate QR code
2. **Friends Join** → Scan & connect wallets  
3. **Split Bill** → Automatic calculation with ZK proofs
4. **Pay Privately** → Each person's amount hidden from others
5. **Cross-Chain** → Pay from any parachain, any token

*30 seconds vs 30 minutes of manual calculation*
