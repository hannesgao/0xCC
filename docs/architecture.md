# 0xCC System Architecture

## Overview
0xCC is a cross-chain P2P payment and bill splitting application built on the Polkadot ecosystem, featuring zero-knowledge privacy protection.

## System Components

### 1. Smart Contracts (ink!)
- **Payment Contract**: Core payment logic for sending/receiving funds
- **Bill Splitting Contract**: Group expense management with ZK privacy
- **Cross-Chain Contract**: XCM message handling and cross-chain operations

### 2. Frontend (React + Polkadot.js)
- **Wallet Integration**: Polkadot.js, Talisman support
- **Payment Interface**: Send payments, split bills, group management
- **Privacy Controls**: ZK proof generation and verification

### 3. Cross-Chain Infrastructure
- **XCM Integration**: Cross-Chain Message Passing for interoperability
- **Hyperbridge Protocol**: Enhanced cross-chain messaging
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Polkadot, Kusama, parachains

### 4. Privacy Layer
- **ZK-SNARKs**: Zero-knowledge proofs for payment privacy
- **Private Balance Proofs**: Prove solvency without revealing amounts
- **Anonymous Group Payments**: Hide individual contributions

## Data Flow

### Payment Flow
1. User initiates payment through frontend
2. Frontend connects to wallet (Polkadot.js/Talisman)
3. Payment contract validates and executes transaction
4. Cross-chain contract handles multi-chain operations
5. Transaction recorded with privacy protection

### Bill Splitting Flow
1. Group creator sets up expense through frontend
2. Bill splitting contract creates group and splits amounts
3. ZK proofs generated to hide individual contributions
4. Group members pay from their preferred chains
5. Settlement occurs across multiple chains if needed

## Security Model

### Privacy Guarantees
- Individual payment amounts remain private
- Group totals are publicly verifiable
- ZK proofs ensure correctness without disclosure

### Cross-Chain Security
- Leverage Polkadot's shared security model
- XCM for trusted cross-chain communication
- Multi-signature validation for large transactions

## Technology Stack

### Smart Contracts
- **Language**: Rust with ink! framework
- **Deployment**: Polkadot parachains
- **Testing**: ink! test framework

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Blockchain Integration**: Polkadot.js API
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with responsive design

### Privacy Technology
- **ZK Framework**: To be determined (arkworks, circom, or noir)
- **Proof System**: ZK-SNARKs for scalability
- **Circuit Design**: Custom circuits for payment privacy

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Basic payment contract functionality
- Simple frontend interface
- Wallet integration

### Phase 2: Cross-Chain Integration
